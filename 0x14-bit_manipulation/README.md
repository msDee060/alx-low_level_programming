# Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation provides low-level control over data, enabling programmers to maximize perfomance
 and minimize memory usage in scenarios where every bit counts.
 Bit manipulation involves manipulating individual bits in binary data.
 It was created to efficiently perform operations at the lowest level of data representation.
