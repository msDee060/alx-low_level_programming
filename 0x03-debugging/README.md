##DEbugging

It is the process of identifying and fixing errors, bugs, or issues in computer code.

##Files
All files are written in C language.

.0-main.c, main.h: This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

.1-main.c:  Comments out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

.2-largest_number.c: Fixes the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

.3-print_remaining_days.c: Fixes the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
