# Static Libraries

A library is made up of useful reusable code, this could be functions, classes, procedures, scripts and configurable data.
A static library is a collection of object code files that are linked with a program at compile time.
It contains precompiled, reusable code and functions that can be incorporated into multiple programs without the need for recompilation.
