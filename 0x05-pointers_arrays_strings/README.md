# Pointers, Arrays and strings

*Pointers_are variables that store memory addresses. They allow you to work with memory directly, providing a way to access and manipulate data.*

*Arrays_are collections of elements of the same data typestored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays provide a way to group multiple values of the same type under one name.*

*Strings_they are arrays of characters.Strings are terminated with a nullcharacter '\0', which indicates the end of the string.*
