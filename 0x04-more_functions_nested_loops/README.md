# Functions, nested loops

This is part of the Month#0 Project done under **ALX Software Engineering Programme**.
The aim of this is to understand how functions, nested loops and header files work in **C**.

##Files
All files contain programs written in C:

| FILENAME | DESCRIPTION |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 0-isupper.c | a function that checks for uppercase character |
| 1-isdigit.c | Checks for a digit (0 through 9) |
| 2-mul.c | Multiplies two integers |
| 3-print_numbers.c | Prints numbers from 0 to 9 |
| 4-print_most_numbers.c | prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. |
| 5-more_numbers.c | prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. |
| 6-print_line.c | draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| 7-print_diagonal.c | draws a diagonal line on the terminal. |
| 8-print_square.c |  prints a square, followed by a new line. |
| 9-fizz_buzz.c | prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. |
| 10-print_triangle.c | prints a triangle, followed by a new line. |
| 100-prime_factor.c | finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line. |
| 101-print_number.c | prints an integer. |
